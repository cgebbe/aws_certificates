## My original plan

### First step (take both exams within 2-3 days) -> maybe take September 1st?

Recommended to study the following two exams around same time:

- [ ] Cloud Practitioner - Optional for people with IT background?!
  - only read [AWS whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-overview.pdf)?
- [ ] Solutions Architect Associate
  - recommends course https://www.pluralsight.com/cloud-guru/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03
  - has 22h of content

Both can be scheduled on same day, or take e.g. Cloud Practitioner 2-3 days earlier

### Second step (take both exams within 5 days!)

Recommended to study the following two exams around same time:

- [ ] Developer Associate
  - https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aws-certified-developer---associate-dva-c01 lasting 20h
  - https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/ lasting 34h
- [ ] SysOpsAssociate
  - https://www.pluralsight.com/cloud-guru/courses/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate lasting only 2h?! (Maybe not supported after all)
  - https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/ lasting 27h

### Third step (take individual)

- [ ] DevOps Engineer professional? -> gets Application Architect and CloudDevOpsEngineer Path

  - requires another 2-3 weeks of studying and doing the practical labs should be sufficient to clear the exam easily.
  - relies heavily on Developer Associate and SysOps Associate, so beneficial to take in near term
  - course from Stephaane https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional-hands-on/
  - 20h of video

- [ ] ML Specialty -> get ML Engineer
  - Course from Stephane Mareek
    - https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-machine-learning/
  - Course on PluralSight (not CloudGuru Ryan Kroonenburg)
    - https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/aws-certified-machine-learning-speciality
  - However, really questionable if this would be helpful to me? Rather take practical coursera course or try out myself

## open questions

- For e.g. ML Specialty, do I need to take previous exams?
  - apparently no requirements, but it makes sense to `stack` them
- How often are they offered?
  - nearly every day, often in the morning around 8am - 11am
- What do they cost?
  - https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/before-testing/#Exam_pricing
  - Foundational 90 EUR
  - Associate 135 EUR
  - Professional / Specialty 270 EUR
- What's the exam like?
  - multiple choice 300 questions online
  - No external helps (neither books, separate screens, personal notes, etc)
  - They monitor your computer, webcam, audio during the exam
